# Heimdall v1 to v2 Migration

This directory contains the documentation and tools to manage the migration from Heimdall v1 to Heimdall v2.
If you are willing to run Heimdall v2, you will need to migrate your existing Heimdall v1 node to the new version.  
This migration process is automated, but still requires some manual steps to execute a coordinated upgrade.  

## ⚠️ Important notice on the migration process
The migration will be executed for the very first time on a node managed by the Polygon team (pilot node).  
Once the migration on that node is successful:
- The v1 genesis will be exported and made available for the community in a GCP bucket together with a checksum
- The v2 genesis will be created and made available for the community in a GCP bucket together with a checksum
- The script will be distributed with the checksum to prevent any tampering and made available for the community on heimdall-v2 repo
- Once the pilot node has been migrated, the genesis and the checksum files are available,
  and the script has been distributed, node operators can perform the migration on their own nodes using the [script](script/migrate.sh)
  (please check the [COMMANDS.md](./script/COMMANDS.md) in case).
  Operators can also execute the migration via [docker](#containerized-migration) or [manually](script/RUNBOOK.md).

### Containerized Migration
You can’t run init on an existing config directory. Not only will genesis.json be in the way, you’ll also run into issues with the existing toml files not having the right content.

Instead, run init without a config or data directory present. If you’re a validator, copy your priv_validator_state.json to data first then run init, but watch out for the format changing - what was previously a string for round now needs to be an integer.

Then copy in the right genesis.json, copy in addrbook.json.

Apply config changes to app.toml and config.toml and you should be good to go. Locations have changed a bit, you can look at the entrypoint script linked above as to what we’re setting and where it is.


If you are using a containerized version of Heimdall (e.g. `docker` or inside a `kubernetes` cluster),
an image will be available to pull once the pilot node migration is successful.
You'd need to back the content of `HEIMDALL_HOME/data` folder up, related to heimdall-v1, for future reference,
and leave that folder empty.
Then, install the docker image.
Now install the default configs for Heimdall v2 by running the following command:
```bash
```bash
  heimdalld init <MONIKER> --chain-id <CHAIN_ID>
```
`<MONIKER>` is the name of your node and `<CHAIN_ID>` is the chain you are running Heimdall-v2 on
(e.g., `heimdallv2-80002` for `amoy`, and `heimdallv2-137` for `mainnet`)
And then apply your custom configuration to the `app.toml`, `config.toml` and `client.toml` files.
Now, download the `genesis.json` file from the GCP bucket URL,
which will be available once the pilot node migration is successful,  
and place it in the `HEIMDALL_HOME/config` directory.
The file is going to be pretty large, especially for mainnet, where it is expected to be around 4–5 GB.
Hence, please make sure you have enough disk space available, and you have a fast internet connection.
At this point, you can run the heimdall-v2 image.

If you prefer to use the migration script, you'd need to make it compatible with your containerized environment.
Otherwise, you can use the [RUNBOOK](script/RUNBOOK.md) to run the migration process manually.
However, we strongly recommend using the containerized approach or the script to avoid mistakes and
ensure a smooth migration process.


### Non-containerized Migration
If you are not using a containerized version of Heimdall (e.g., `Linux/Debian`),
please refer to [these instructions](./script/README.md) for more information
on how to use the migration bash script.
Moreover, [this doc](./script/COMMANDS.md) provides a detailed list of commands to execute the v1→v2 migration.  
Please skip the points marked as `(Internal)` as they are not relevant for the community.  

### Manual Migration
If you prefer not to use any script, but rather execute the migration manually, you can follow the instructions in
the [runbook](./script/RUNBOOK.md).
However, we strongly recommend using the script or the containerized approach to avoid mistakes,  
execute fast, and ensure a smooth migration process.
